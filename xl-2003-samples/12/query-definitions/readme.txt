These files have been created with MS Query. They are provided here only for the reason of completeness. Unforunately, they have little immediate value, as MS Query saves the file names of database files with absolute path names.

Therefore, the queries can only be used if the database file is at the same place as it was on the computer of the author (I:\Code\xl-2000), or if a editor is used to replace this path by the actual path of NWind.mdb on your computer.
